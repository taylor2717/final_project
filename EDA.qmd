## Introduction

In this analysis, I explore the Diabetes Health Indicators dataset
(diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv), which is based on the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey.

- Response variable: Diabetes_binary
  - 0 = No diabetes
  - 1 = Diabetes
- Goal of EDA:
  - Understand the distribution of key health indicators.
  - Explore how these indicators relate to diabetes status.
  - Prepare for building predictive models in the Modeling document.

I focus on the following predictors (a subset of the full data):
- HighBP – high blood pressure
- HighChol – high cholesterol
- BMI – body mass index (numeric)
- Smoker – has smoked at least 100 cigarettes
- PhysActivity – physical activity in past 30 days
- GenHlth – general health (1 = excellent to 5 = poor)
- MentHlth – days of poor mental health
- PhysHlth – days of poor physical health
- DiffWalk – serious difficulty walking
- Sex – biological sex
- Age – age category
- Income – income category

These variables will form the basis of my later predictive modeling.
